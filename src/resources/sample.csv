Update renewal analyzer to handle more multiple exception cases,At the moment the renewal_analyzer.py only handles 'VARATTU' exceptions. Other exception cases can occur and should be handled.,16,https://gitlab.com/rasse-posse/helmet-lainojen-uusija/-/issues/16,Open,Rasmus Paltschik,rjpalt,Rasmus Paltschik,rjpalt,No,No,,2022-07-20 03:37:45,2022-11-03 03:51:50,,,,,0,0
Create basis for a logging tool,"The basic idea for logger: https://ohjelmistotuotanto-hy-avoin.github.io/tehtavat2/ and why it's done is in the materials (avoid dependencies).

You can:
A) Build a simple logger as a logger.py file. In the beginning it only needs to handle print commands. In it's full format it should create a separate log file (format: ddMMyymmss_log.txt) into a directory called logs of every run the script has. The zero version would then handle print commands by printing them into the console AND writing into a session file containing alle the printed out lines with a timestamp. Format would be something like:
`[2022-07-20T03:45:02Z]Printed line: 'Session debugging line printed here'`

B) Check what cool logging libraries there are for use. Like log4j!",17,https://gitlab.com/rasse-posse/helmet-lainojen-uusija/-/issues/17,Open,Rasmus Paltschik,rjpalt,Evgenii Smirnov,jevgenix,No,No,,2022-07-20 03:46:18,2022-08-01 10:05:38,,,,,0,0
